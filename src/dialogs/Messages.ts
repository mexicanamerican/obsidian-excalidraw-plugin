The Excalidraw Obsidian plugin is much more than "just" a drawing tool. To help you get started here's a showcase of the key Excalidraw plugin features.

If you'd like to learn more, please subscribe to my YouTube channel: [Visual PKM](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC0gns4a9fhVkGkngvSumAQ) where I regularly share videos about Obsidian-Excalidraw and about tools and techniques for Visual Personal Knowledge Management.

Thank you & Enjoy!

</div></div>

## Fixed
- When updating Excalidraw, some open drawings weren't automatically reopening. I hope I got this fixed (note this change will only have an effect when you receive the update after this).
- In dark mode, the frame header is challenging to see when modified [#1568](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1568).

## New
- Crop PDF pages:
  - Available in Excalidraw, Markdown Notes, and on the Canvas.
  - Crop the active page from the embedded PDF viewer and insert the cropped image into the current view, both in Excalidraw and on Canvas.
- New Command Palette Action: "Insert active PDF page as image." This action is functional in Excalidraw. If an embedded Obsidian-PDF-viewer is present, executing this command will insert the active page as an image into the Excalidraw scene.
- Two new settings introduced:
  - "Basic" section allows setting the folder for crop files.
  - "Saving/filename" section enables setting the prefix for crop files.
- PDF import now defaults to importing all pages.
- Rounded corners now available for images.
- Second-order links now encompass forward links from embedded Excalidraw Files.
- Clicking a cropped file in a markdown note or on Canvas will prompt to open the original file, not just the cropper.

  </a>
</div>

- [Crop Vintage Mask Script](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Crop%20Vintage%20Mask.md) adds rounded corner mask to cropped images. Install it from the script library.
- Advanced Setting: Modify image zoom memory limit for sharper zoom. See under "Non-Excalidraw.com Supported Features" in settings.
- Laser Pointer will not activate on double-click in ExcaliBrain

## Fixed
- Resolved cropping issue with rotated images.

## New in ExcalidrawAutomate
- You can now specify elementId to add functions: addLine, addArrow, addRect, etc.
- ea.help() now provides help on Script Engine utils functions as well
- ea.isExcalidrawMask(file?:TFile) will return true if the currently open view or the supplied file is an Excalidraw Mask file.
`,
"2.0.17":`
## Fixed
- Image cropping now supports dark mode
- Image cropping/carve out was not working reliably in some cases [#1546](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1546)
- Masking a mirrored image resulted in an off-positioned mask

## New
- Context menu action to convert SVG to Excalidraw strokes
- Updated Chinese translation (Thank you @tswwe)
`,
"2.0.16":`
## Fixed
- Image cropping did not work consistently with large image files on lower-powered devices [#1538](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1538).

## New
- Crop and Mask Images in Excalidraw, Canvas, and Markdown. (Inspired by @bonecast [#4566](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/4566))
- Draw metadata around images but hide it on the export.

## Fixed
- Freedraw closed circles (2nd attempt)
- Interactive Markdown embeddable border-color (setting did not have an effect)
`,
"2.0.14":`
## New
- Stylus button now activates the eraser function. Note: This feature is supported for styluses that comply with industry-standard button events. Unfortunately, Samsung SPEN and Apple Pencil do not support this functionality.

## Fixed
- Improved handwriting quality. I have resolved the long-standing issue of closing the loop when ends of the line are close, making an "u" into an "o" ([#1529](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1529) and [#6303](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/6303)).
- Improved Excalidraw's full-screen mode behavior. Access it via the Obsidian Command Palette or the full-screen button on the Obsidian Tools Panel ([#1528](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1528)).
- Fixed color picker overlapping with the Obsidian mobile toolbar on Obsidian-Mobile.
- Corrected display issues with alternative font sizes (Fibonacci and Zoom relative) in the element properties panel when editing a text element (refer to [2.0.11 Release Notes](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/releases/tag/2.0.11) for details about the font-size Easter Egg).
- Resolved the issue where Excalidraw SVG exports containing LaTeX were not loading correctly into Inkscape ([#1519](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/pull/1519)). Thanks to üôè@HyunggyuJang for the contribution.
`,
"2.0.13":`
## Fixed
- Excalidraw crashes if you paste an image and right-click on canvas immediately after pasting.
`,
"2.0.12":`
## Fixed
- Stencil library not working [#1516](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1516), [#1517](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1517)
- The new convert image from URL to Local File feature did not work in two situations:
  - When the embedded image is downloaded from a very slow server (e.g. OpenAIs temp image server)
  - On Android
- The postToOpenAI function did not work in all situations on Android.
- ExcaliAI wireframe to code did not display correctly on Android
- Tooltips kept popping up on Android.

## New
- Added "Save image from URL to local file" to the right-click context menu
- Further [ExcaliAI](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/ExcaliAI.md) improvements including support for image editing with image mask
`,
"2.0.11":`
## Fixed
- Resolved an Obsidian performance issue caused by simultaneous installations of Excalidraw and the Minimal theme. Optimized Excalidraw CSS loading into Obsidian since April 2021, resulting in noticeable performance improvements. ([#1456](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1456))
- Removed default support for the [Sliding Panes Plugin](https://github.com/deathau/sliding-panes-obsidian) due to compatibility issues with Obsidian Workspaces. Obsidian's "Stack Tabs" feature now supersedes Sliding Panes. To re-enable sliding panes support, navigate to Compatibility Features in Plugin Settings.
- Sometimes images referenced with URLs did not show in exported scenes and when embedding Excalidraw into a markdown note. I hope all that is now resolved.
- ExcalidrawAutomate scripts sometimes were not able to save their settings.

## New
- Introduced an "Easter Egg" feature in font-size properties:
  - Hold SHIFT while selecting font size to use scaled sizes (S, M, L, XL) based on the current canvas zoom, ensuring consistent sizes within zoom ranges.
  - Hold ALT/OPT while selecting font size to use values based on the golden mean (s:16, m:26, l:42, xl:68). ALT+SHIFT scales font sizes based on canvas zoom.
  - Scaled sizes are sticky; new text elements adjust font sizes relative to the canvas zoom. Deselect SHIFT to disable this feature.
  - For more on the Golden Scale, watch [The Golden Opportunity](https://youtu.be/2SHn_ruax-s).
- Added two new Command Palette Actions:
  - "Decompress current Excalidraw File" in Markdown View mode helps repair corrupted, compressed Excalidraw files manually.
  - "Save image from URL to local file" saves referenced URL images to your Vault, replacing images in the drawing.
- Updated the ExcaliAI script to generate images using ExcaliAI.

## New in ExcalidrawAutomate
- Added additional documentation about functions to ea.suggester.
- Added ea.help(). You can use this function from Developer Console to print help information about functions. Usage: ${String.fromCharCode(96)}ea.help(ea.functionName)${String.fromCharCode(96)} or ${String.fromCharCode(96)}ea.help('propertyName')${String.fromCharCode(96)} - notice property name is in quotes.
`,
"2.0.10":`
One more minor tweak to support an updated ExcaliAI script - now available in the script store.
`,
"2.0.9":`
This release is very minor, and I apologize for the frequent updates in a short span. I chose not to delay this fix for 1-2 weeks, waiting for my larger release. The WireframeToAI feature wasn't working in 2.0.8, but now it does.
`,
"2.0.8":`
## New
- Mermaid Class Diagrams [#7381](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7381)
- New Scripts:
  - Repeat Texts contributed by @soraliu [#1425](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/pull/1425)
  - Relative Font Size Cycle [#1474](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1474)
- New setting to configure the URL used to reach the OpenAI API - for setting an OpenAI API compatible local LLM URL.

## Fixed
- web images with jpeg extension were not displayed. [#1486](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1486)
- MathJax was causing errors on the file in the active editor when starting Obsidian or starting the Excalidraw Plugin. I reworked the MathJax implementation from the ground up. [#1484](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1484), [#1473](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1473)
- Enhanced performance for resizing sticky notes (resize + ALT) on slower devices when centrally adjusting their size.

## New in ExcalidrawAutomate:
- New ArrowHead types. Currently only available programmatically and when converting Mermaid Class Diagrams into Excalidraw Objects:
${String.fromCharCode(96,96,96)}ts
  addArrow(
    points: [x: number, y: number][],
    formatting?: {
      startArrowHead?: "arrow"|"bar"|"circle"|"circle_outline"|"triangle"|"triangle_outline"|"diamond"|"diamond_outline"|null;
      endArrowHead?: "arrow"|"bar"|"circle"|"circle_outline"|"triangle"|"triangle_outline"|"diamond"|"diamond_outline"|null;

    connectionA: ConnectionPoint | null,
    objectB: string,
    connectionB: ConnectionPoint | null,
    formatting?: {
      numberOfPoints?: number;

      endArrowHead?: "arrow"|"bar"|"circle"|"circle_outline"|"triangle"|"triangle_outline"|"diamond"|"diamond_outline"|null;
      padding?: number;
    },
  ): string;

  connectObjectWithViewSelectedElement(
    objectA: string,
    connectionA: ConnectionPoint | null,
    connectionB: ConnectionPoint | null,
    formatting?: {
      numberOfPoints?: number;

# Fixed
- The Android and iOS crash with 2.0.5 üò∞. I can't apologize enough for releasing a version that I did not properly test on Android and iOS. That ought to teach me something about last-minute changes before hitting release.
- Scaled-resizing a sticky note (SHIFT+resize) caused Excalidraw to choke on slower devices
- Improved plugin performance focusing on minimizing Excalidraw's effect on Obsidian overall
- Images embedded with a URL often did not show up in image exports, hopefully, the issue will less frequently occur in the future.
- Local file URL now follows Obsidian standard - making it easier to navigate in Markdown view mode.

# New
- Bonus feature compared to 2.0.4: Second-order links when clicking embedded images. I use images to connect ideas. Clicking on an image and seeing all the connections immediately is very powerful.
- In plugin settings, under "Startup Script", the button now opens the startup script if it already exists.
- Partial support for animated GIFs (will not show up in image exports, but can be added as interactive embeddables)
- Configurable modifier keys for link click action and drag&drop actions.
- Improved support for drag&drop from your local drive and embedding of files external to Excalidraw.

## New
- ExcaliAI
- You can now add ${String.fromCharCode(96)}ex-md-font-hand-drawn${String.fromCharCode(96)} or ${String.fromCharCode(96)}ex-md-font-hand-drawn${String.fromCharCode(96)} to the ${String.fromCharCode(96)}cssclasses:${String.fromCharCode(96)} frontmatter property in embedded markdown nodes and their font face will match the respective Excalidraw fonts.

## Fixed
- Adding a script for the very first time (when the script folder did not yet exist) did not show up in the tools panel. Required an Obsidian restart. 
- Performance improvements

## New and updated In Excalidraw Automate
- Added many new functions and some features to existing functions. See the [release notes](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/releases/tag/2.0.3) for details
`,
"2.0.3":`
## Fixed
- Mermaid to Excalidraw stopped working after installing the Obsidian 1.5.0 insider build. [#1450](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1450)
- CTRL+Click on a Mermaid diagram did not open the Mermaid editor.
- Embed color settings were not honored when the embedded markdown was focused on a section or block.
- Scrollbars were visible when the embeddable was set to transparent (set background color to match element background, and set element background color to "transparent").

</div></div>

## Fixed
- Resolved an issue where the Command Palette's "Toggle between Excalidraw and Markdown mode" failed to uncompress the Excalidraw JSON for editing.

## New
- Scaling feature for embedded objects (markdown documents, pdfs, YouTube, etc.): Hold down the SHIFT key while resizing elements to adjust their size.
- Expanded support for Canvas Candy. Regardless of Canvas Candy, you can apply CSS classes to embedded markdown documents for transparency, shape adjustments, text orientation, and more.
- Added new functionalities to the active embeddable top-left menu:
  - Document Properties (cog icon)
    - File renaming
    - Basic styling options for embedded markdown documents
    - Setting YouTube start time
  - Zoom to full screen for PDFs
- Improved immersive embedding of Excalidraw into Obsidian Canvas.
- Introduced new Command Palette Actions:

</div></div>

## New
- Added support for applying CSS classes in frontmatter. Now, when embedding Excalidraw drawings into Obsidian Canvas, you can use [Canvas Candy](https://tfthacker.com/canvas-candy) classes. For instance, ${String.fromCharCode(96)}cssclasses: cc-border-none${String.fromCharCode(96)} removes the canvas node border around the drawing.
- Introduced new context menu actions:
  - Navigate to link or embedded image.
  - Add any file from the vault to the canvas.
  - Convert the selected text element or sticky note to an embedded markdown file.
  - Add a link from the Vault to the selected element.
- Frames are now rendered in exported images.
- SVG Export includes the ${String.fromCharCode(96)}.excalidraw-svg${String.fromCharCode(96)} class, enabling post-processing of SVGs using publish.js when using custom domains with Obsidian Publish. Also, added a command palette action ${String.fromCharCode(96)}Obsidian Publish: Find SVG and PNG exports that are out of date${String.fromCharCode(96)}.
- Added a new Command palette action to open the corresponding Excalidraw file based on the embedded SVG or PNG file. ${String.fromCharCode(96)}Open Excalidraw Drawing${String.fromCharCode(96)} [Issue #1411](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1411)

## Fixed and Improved
- Resolved issue with the Mermaid Timeline graph displaying all black. [Issue #1424](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1424)
- Enabled toggling pen mode off after activation by a pen touch.
- Now you are able to unlock elements on mobile; previously, locked elements couldn't be selected.
- Fixed the disabled ${String.fromCharCode(96)}complete line button${String.fromCharCode(96)} for multipoint lines on mobile.

`,
"1.9.28":`
## Fixed & Improved
- Fixed an issue where the toolbar lost focus, requiring two clicks. This caused a problem when the hand tool was activated from ExcalidrawAutomate script when opening a drawing, causing buttons to stop working. [#1344](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1344)
- Resolved a caching issue affecting image area-links and group-links, making them work inconsistently. For more details, refer to the discussion on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1026825302900494357/1169311900308361318).
- Improved frame colors with Dynamic Coloring.
- Added support for multiline LaTeX formulas. [#1403](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1403)
- Fixed the issue of Chinese characters overlapping in MathJax. [#1406](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1406)

## New
- Added support for Mermaid to Excalidraw **Sequence Diagrams**.
- If an image contains an element link, clicking on the image will now open the link chooser, allowing you to decide whether to open the image or follow the element link.
- When hovering over an image that also has an element link, the hover preview will display the contents of the link.
- You can now choose to **import PDFs** in columns instead of rows. Additionally, you have the option to group all pages after import, which will improve the unlocking experience if you also lock pages on import.
- Introduced configuration options for the **Laser Tool**, including pointer color, decay length, and time. ([#1408](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1408), [#1220](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1220))

`,
"1.9.27": `
## New
- Restructured plugin settings, added additional comments and relevant videos
- Added setting to change PDF to Image resolution/scale. This has an effect when embedding PDF pages to Excalidraw. A lower value will result in less-sharp pages, but better overall performance. Also, larger pages (higher scale value) were not accepted by Excalidraw.com when copying from Obsidian due to the 2MB image file limit.  Find the "PDF to Image" setting under "Embedding Excalidraw into your Notes and Exporting" setting. [#1393](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1393)

## Fixed
- When multiple Excalidraw Scripts were executed parallel a race condition occurred causing scripts to override each other
- I implemented a partial fix to "text detaching from figures when dragging them" [#1400](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1400)
- Regression: extra thin stroke removed with 1.9.26 [#1399](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1399)`,
"1.9.26":`
## Fixes and improvements from Excalidraw.com
- Freedraw shape selection issue, when fill-pattern is not solid [#7193](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7193)
- Actions panel UX improvement [#6850](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6850)

## Fixed in plugin
- After inserting PDF pages as image the size of inserted images were incorrectly anchored preventing resizing of pages. The fix does not solve the issue with already imported pages, but pages you import in the future will not be anchored. 
- Mobile toolbar flashes up on tab change on desktop
- Toolbar buttons are active on the first click after opening a drawing. This addresses the "hand" issue raised here: [#1344](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1344)
`,
"1.9.25":`
## Fixed
- Fixed issues with creating Markdown or Excalidraw files for non-existing documents [#1385](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1385)
- Resolved a bug where changing the section/block filter after duplicating a markdown embeddable now works correctly on the first attempt [#1387](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1387)

## New
- Easily create a markdown file and embed it as an embedded frame with a single click when clicking a link pointing to a non-existent file.
![image](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/assets/14358394/4b9de54d-2382-4a52-b500-918ba2a60133)
- Offline LaTeX support. The MathJax package is now included in the plugin, eliminating the need for an internet connection. [#1383](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1383), [#936](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/936), [#1289](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1289)

## Minor Updates from excalidraw.com
- Improved the laser pointer in dark mode.
- Removed bound arrows from frames.
- Enhanced fill rendering.
- Maintained the z-order of elements added to frames.

## New in ExcalidrawAutomate
- Introduced two LZString functions in ExcalidrawAutomate:
${String.fromCharCode(96,96,96)}typescript
compressToBase64(str:string):string;
decompressFromBase64(str:string):string;
${String.fromCharCode(96,96,96)}
`,
"1.9.24":`
## Fixed
- Resolved some hidden Image and Backup Cache initialization errors.

## New Features
- Introducing the ${String.fromCharCode(96)}[[cmd://cmd-id]]${String.fromCharCode(96)} link type, along with a new Command Palette Action: ${String.fromCharCode(96)}Insert Obsidian Command as a link${String.fromCharCode(96)}. With this update, you can now add any command available on the Obsidian Command palette as a link in Excalidraw. When you click the link, the corresponding command will be executed. This feature opens up exciting possibilities for automating your drawings by creating Excalidraw Scripts and attaching them to elements.

- I am thrilled to announce that you can now embed images directly from your local hard drive in Excalidraw. These files won't be moved into Obsidian. Please note, however, that these images won't be synchronized across your other devices. [#1365](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1365)

## Fixed
- Fourth Font displays correctly in SVG embeds mode
- The re-colorMap map (see [1.9.19](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/releases/tag/1.9.19) for more info) did not work when either of the fill or stroke color properties of the image was missing.

- Excalidraw's native eyedropper fixes [#7019](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/7019)

## New
- Now you can insert [Mermaid](https://mermaid.live/) diagrams as Excalidraw elements into your drawings (currently only the [Flowchart](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html) type is supported, [other diagram types](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/#diagram-types) are inserted as Mermaid native images. 
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è**This feature requires Obsidian API v1.4.14 (the latest desktop version). On Obsidian mobile API v1.4.14 is only available to Obsidian insiders currently**
  - If you want to contribute to the project please head over to [mermaid-to-excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/mermaid-to-excalidraw) and help create the converters for the other diagram types.
- The Fourth Font now also supports the OTF format
- Disable snap-to-grid in grid mode by holding down the CTRL/CMD while drawing or moving an element [#6983](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6983)
- I updated the Excalidraw logo in Obsidian. This affects the logo on the tab and the ribbon.

## New
- Excalidraw now syncs with Obsidian's language settings, provided translations are available. [#1297](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1297)

## Fixed
- [#1285](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1285): Solved Obsidian crashes caused by copying images from Excalidraw into markdown notes. Going forward:
  - Copying an image will paste its embed link,
  - Copying a text element will paste the text,
  - For all other elements with links, the link will be pasted.
  - In all other cases nothing will be pasted.
  
- Resolved grid instability ([#1298](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1298)).
- Fixed missing ${String.fromCharCode(96)}[[square brackets]]${String.fromCharCode(96)} in PDF section references, making the links functional.
- Corrected the behavior of "Open current link in browser" for embedded YouTube and Vimeo frames. Clicking the globe button will now correctly open the links.
`,
"1.9.17":`
## New 
- Significant performance improvements from Excalidraw.com
- When selecting a highlight in the Obsidian PDF editor and selecting "Copy as Quote" in the context menu, then paste this to Excalidraw, the text will arrive as a text element wrapped in a transparent sticky note with the link to the original highlight attached to the sticky note. You can override this behavior by SHIFT+CTRL/CMD pasting

## Fixed
- BUG: Image caching issue. Changes to the drawing do not reflect immediately in the note when re-opening the drawing [#1297](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1279)
- Removed underline from links in NativeSVG embed.

I apologize for this extra release. I accidentally built 1.9.15 with an older excalidraw.com package version. Fixes and new features (like the improved grid) are now available again. Otherwise, this is the same as 1.9.15. Sorry for the inconvenience.
`,
"1.9.15":`
## New
- There is now a search box in the Excliadraw Script Store. I categorized the scripts and added keywords to help easier navigation.

## Fixed
- The theme of the embedded Markdown document did not always honor plugin settings. With some themes, it worked, with others (including the default Obsidian theme, it didn't). 
`,
"1.9.14":`
# Fixed
- **Dynamic Styling**: Excalidraw ${String.fromCharCode(96)}Plugin Settings/Display/Dynamic Styling${String.fromCharCode(96)} did not handle theme changes correctly.
- **Section References**: Section Headings that contained a dot (e.g. #2022.01.01) (or other special characters) did not work when focusing markdown embeds to a section. [#1262](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1262)
- **PNG Export**: When using images from the web (i.e. based on URL and not a file from your Vault), embedding the Excalidraw file into a markdown document as PNG, or exporting as PNG failed. This is because due to browser cross-origin restrictions, Excalidraw is unable to access the image. In such cases, a placeholder will be included in the export, but the export will not fail, as until now.

# New in ExcalidrawAutomate
- ${String.fromCharCode(96)}getActiveEmbeddableViewOrEditor${String.fromCharCode(96)} will return the active editor and file in case of a markdown document or the active leaf.view for other files (e.g. PDF, MP4 player, Kanban, Canvas, etc) of the currently active embedded object. This function can be used by plugins to check if an editor is available and obtain the view or editor to perform their actions. Example: [package.json](https://github.com/zsviczian/excalibrain/blob/2056a021af7c3a53ed08203a77f6eae304ca6e39/package.json#L23), [Checking for EA](https://github.com/zsviczian/excalibrain/blob/2056a021af7c3a53ed08203a77f6eae304ca6e39/src/excalibrain-main.ts#L114-L127), and [Running the function](https://github.com/zsviczian/excalibrain/blob/2056a021af7c3a53ed08203a77f6eae304ca6e39/src/excalibrain-main.ts#L362-L399)

# New
- **Templater support**: You can now execute Templater scripts on an embedded Markdown document when the document is active for editing
- **Interactive image-embeds**: I added a new image embed option "SVG Native". In "SVG Native" mode embedded items such as videos, webpages, and links (including links within the Vault) work.
- **Anchored image resizing**: When you embed an Excalidraw drawing using the Anchor to 100% option, resizing the image will be disabled.

- Popout windows behaved inconsistently losing focus at the time when a markdown file was embedded. Hopefully, this is now working as intended.
- A number of small fixes that will also improve the ExcaliBrain experience
`,
"1.9.11":`
# New
- I added 2 new command palette actions: 1) to toggle frame clipping and 2) to toggle frame rendering.

# Updated
- I released a minor update to the slideshow script. Frame sequence (Frame 1, 2, 3, ...) will now be displayed in proper order. Frames will be hidden during the presentation (this was there before, but there was a change to excalidraw.com that broke this feature of the slideshow script).

## New
- @mazurov added a new script: [Ellipse Selected Elements](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Ellipse%20Selected%20Elements.md)

## Fixed
- **Image Saving Error**: Previously, inserting an image from Firebase Storage or other URLs could result in an error that prevented the entire drawing from being saved. I have now improved the error handling and image fetching from the web, ensuring smooth image insertion and saving.  
- **Text Search Bug**: There was an issue where text search failed when frames had default names like "Frame 1," "Frame 2," etc. This has been resolved, and now the text search works correctly in such cases. ([#1239](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1239))   
- **Image Positioning Fix**: An annoying bug caused the image to jump after inserting it using the "Insert Image" command palette action. I've fixed this issue, and now the image behaves as expected when positioning it for the first time.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

I updated embedded frames for compatibility with excalidraw.com. To ensure everything works smoothly:

üîÑ Update Excalidraw on all your devices.

This will avoid any issues with converted files and let you enjoy the new features seamlessly.

Thank you for your understanding. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

## Fixed:
- PNG image caching resulting in broken images after Obsidian restarts
- SVG export now displays embedded iframes with the correct embed link (note this feature only works when you open the SVGs in a browser outside Obsidian).

## Updated / fixed in Excalidraw Automate
- I updated ${String.fromCharCode(96)}lib/ExcalidrawAutomate.d.ts${String.fromCharCode(96)} and published a new version of obsidian-excalidraw-plugin type library to npmjs.
- Added new ExcalidrawAutomate functions: ${String.fromCharCode(96)} addEmbeddable()${String.fromCharCode(96)}, ${String.fromCharCode(96)}DEVICE${String.fromCharCode(96)}, ${String.fromCharCode(96)}newFilePrompt()${String.fromCharCode(96)}, and ${String.fromCharCode(96)}getLeaf()${String.fromCharCode(96)}
- ${String.fromCharCode(96)}addImage${String.fromCharCode(96)} and ${String.fromCharCode(96)}addElementsToView${String.fromCharCode(96)} were extended with 1-1 additional optional parameter. As a result of ${String.fromCharCode(96)}shouldRestoreElements${String.fromCharCode(96)} defaulting to false, all elements in the scene will no longer be updated (iframes will not blink) when you add elements via script.
- There is a new event hook: ${String.fromCharCode(96)}onPasteHook${String.fromCharCode(96)}. This will be called whenever the user pastes something to the canvas. You can use this callback if you want to do something additional during the onPaste event. In case you want to prevent the Excalidraw default onPaste action you must return false

${String.fromCharCode(96,96,96)}typescript
async addImage(
  topX: number,
  topY: number,
  imageFile: TFile | string,
  scale: boolean = true,
  anchor: boolean = true,

"1.9.8":`
## New Features
- Zoom to heading and block in markdown frames.
- Added an iframe menu that allows users to change heading/block zoom, center the element, and open it in the browser.
- Replaced twitframe with platform.twitter for tweets. The "Read more" and "Reply" buttons now work. Embedded tweets will honor theme settings.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where embedded markdown frames disappeared in fullscreen mode. [#1197](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1197)
- Resolved a problem with the "Embed Markdown as Image" feature where changes to embed properties were not always honored. [#1201](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1201)
- When inserting any file from the Vault and embedding a Markdown document as an image, the embed now correctly honors the section heading if specified. [#1200](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1200)
- SVG and PNG autoexport now function properly when closing a popout window. [#1209](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1209)
- Many other minor fixes
`,
"1.9.7":`
## Fixed:

- Fixed an issue where using the color picker shortcut would cause the UI to disappear in mobile view mode.
- You can now add YouTube playlists to iframes.
- Fixed a bug where the "Add any file" dropdown suggester opened in the main Obsidian workspace instead of the popout window when Excalidraw was running. ([#1179](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1191))
- Made some improvements to the logic of opening in the adjacent pane, although it is still not perfect.
- Fixed an issue where Obsidian sync would result in the loss of the last approximately 20 seconds of work. Excalidraw's handling of sync is now fixed. ([#1189](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1189))

## New:

- Introducing Image Cache: Excalidraw will now cache rendered images embedded in Markdown documents, which will enhance the markdown rendering experience.
- Backup Cache: Excalidraw now stores a backup on your device when saving, in case the application is terminated during a save operation. If you are using sync, you can find the latest backup on the device you last used to edit your drawing.
- Added ${String.fromCharCode(96)}frame=${String.fromCharCode(96)} parameter to image references. ([#1194](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1194)) For more details about this feature, check out this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/yZQoJg2RCKI).
- When an SVG image from Draw.io is embedded in Excalidraw, clicking the image will open the file in the [Diagram plugin](https://github.com/zapthedingbat/drawio-obsidian) (if available).
- Added the [Create DrawIO file](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Create%20DrawIO%20file.md) Excalidraw Automate Script to the library, which allows you to create a new draw.io drawing and add it to the current Excalidraw canvas.

  - the accent color with the default Obsidian theme
  - the drawing theme color with the out of the box, default new drawing (not using a template)
- The Obsidian tools panel did not pick up user scripts when installing your very first script. A reload of Obsidian was required.

- BUG: Area embed link of svg inside excalidraw embed entire svg instead of area [#1098](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1098)

## New
- I updated the [Scribble Helper](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Scribble%20Helper.md) script with tons of new features. I am still beta testing the script. I will release a demo video in the next few days.

## New in Excalidraw Automate
- I added many more configuration options for the scriptEngine utils.inputPrompt function. See [Scribble Helper](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Scribble%20Helper.md) for a demonstration of this new feature.

## Fixes
- Fixed palm rejection to prevent unwanted spikes when using the freedraw tool. ([#1065](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1065))
- Fixed issue where images disappeared when zoomed in. ([#6417](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6417))
- Autosave will now save the drawing when you change the theme from dark to light or vice versa. ([#1080](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1080))
- Added padding to short LaTeX formulas to prevent cropping. ([#1053](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1053))

## New Features
- Added a new command palette action: Toggle to invert default binding behavior. This new feature allows you to switch between normal and inverted mode. In normal mode, arrows will bind to objects unless you hold the CTRL/CMD key while drawing the arrow or moving objects. In inverted mode, arrows will not bind to objects unless you hold the CTRL/CMD key while drawing the arrow or moving objects.
- You can now set a template LaTeX formula in the plugin settings (under experimental features) to be used when creating a new LaTeX formula. ([#1090](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1090))
- Redesigned the Image Export dialog. I hope dropdowns are now more intuitive than the toggles were.
- Added the ability to export only the selected part of a drawing. See the Export dialog for more information.
- Added a zigzag fill easter egg. See a demo of this feature [here](https://twitter.com/excalidraw/status/1645428942344445952?s=61&t=nivKLx2vgl6hdv2EbW4mZg).
- Added a new expert function: recolor embedded Excalidraw and SVG images (not JPG, PNG, BMP, WEBP, GIF). See a demo of this feature here:

## Fixed
- Styling of custom pen and script buttons in the side panel was inverted.
- Minor tweaks to dynamic styling. [see this video to understand dynamic styling](https://youtu.be/fypDth_-8q0)

## New
- New scripts by @threethan:
  - [Auto Draw for Pen](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Auto%20Draw%20for%20Pen.md): Automatically switches between the select and draw tools, based on whether a pen is being used. Supports most pens including Apple Pencil.
  - [Hardware Eraser Support](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Hardware%20Eraser%20Support.md): Adds support for pen inversion, a.k.a. the hardware eraser on the back of your pen. Supports Windows based styluses. Does not suppoprt Apple Pencil or S-Pen.
- Added separate buttons to support copying link, area or group references to objects on the drawing. [#1063](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1063). See [this video](https://youtu.be/yZQoJg2RCKI) for more details on how this works.
- Hover preview will no longer trigger for image files (.png, .svg, .jpg, .gif, .webp, .bmp, .ico, .excalidraw)
- Minor updates to the [Slideshow](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Slideshow.md) script. You can download the updated script from the Excalidraw script library.  The slideshow will now correctly run also when initiated in a popout window. When the drawing is in a popout window, the slideshow will not be full screen, but will only occupy the popout window. If you run the slideshow from the main Obsidian workspace, it will be displayed in full-screen mode.
- Updated the Icon Library script to now include image keywords under each of the images to allow searching for keywords (CTRL/CMD+F). I've uploaded the new script to [here](https://gist.github.com/zsviczian/33ff695d5b990de1ebe8b82e541c26ad). If you need further information watch this [video](https://youtu.be/_OEljzZ33H8)

## New in ExcalidrawAutomate
- ${String.fromCharCode(96)}addText${String.fromCharCode(96)} ${String.fromCharCode(96)}formatting${String.fromCharCode(96)} parameter now accepts ${String.fromCharCode(96)}boxStrokeColor${String.fromCharCode(96)} and ${String.fromCharCode(96)}textVerticalAlign${String.fromCharCode(96)} values.
${String.fromCharCode(96,96,96)}typescript
addText(

- new ${String.fromCharCode(96)}onFileOpenHook${String.fromCharCode(96)}. If set, this callback is triggered, when an Excalidraw file is opened. You can use this callback in case you want to do something additional when the file is opened. This will run before the file level script defined in the ${String.fromCharCode(96)}excalidraw-onload-script${String.fromCharCode(96)} frontmatter is executed. Excalidraw will await the result of operations here.  Handle with care. If you change data such as the frontmatter of the underlying file, I haven't tested how it will behave.
${String.fromCharCode(96,96,96)}typescript
onFileOpenHook: (data: {
  ea: ExcalidrawAutomate;
  excalidrawFile: TFile; //the file being loaded
  view: ExcalidrawView;

## Fixed: Text wrapping issue in sticky notes

I fixed an issue where text would wrap differently and words would disappear during text editing in sticky notes. You can check out the details on [GitHub #6318](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/6331).

I am aware of three additional issues related to container text editing that are still open. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the recent change in how text size is calculated on Excalidraw.com, which has had a knock-on effect on Obsidian. I am actively working to address the following issues:

- Pinch zooming while editing text in a text container [GitHub #6331](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/6331)
- Container text jumps on edit on Android with on-screen keyboard [GitHub #6330](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/6330)
- Shadow text when editing text containers without a keyboard on iOS [GitHub #6329](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/6329)

Thank you for your patience while I work on resolving these issues.

"1.8.13": `
## Fixed
- When changing a text element in markdown mode, the change seem to have showed up when switching back to Excalidraw  mode, but then lost these changes when loading the file the next time.
- Scrolling through a page that has embedded drawings on Obsidian Mobile accidently opens the drawing in Excalidraw when touching the image. Now you need to press and hold to open the image in Excalidraw. [#1003](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/1003)
- The scrollbar is no longer visible when presenting using the SlideShow script
- Stroke properties could not be changed when custom pen settings had "Stroke & fill applies to: All shapes". It works now.

## QoL
- Custom pens will remember the stroke changes until you press the pen preset button again.
  - This is a bit hard to explain, let me try... Essentially, when you use a custom pen, it will keep the changes you made to the pen (like changing the stroke width) until you press the pen-prereset button again. So, for example, if you're using a mind mapping custom pen and change its color, and then switch to a different tool like text, when you switch back to the freedraw tool using the Excalidraw tools panel, the pen will still have the same color you set earlier, but if you press the mind mapping pen-preset button, it will default back to your custom pen settings including your preset color.
- Added new buttons to load current stroke color and background color in the pen settings dialog. Also added an edit box so you can configure any valid color string (including with transparency) for pen stroke and background colors.

# New
- Support for referencing images from the internet in Excalidraw drawings, including YouTube thumbnail support. [#913](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/913)
  - Link to images on the internet without creating a copy in your Vault by holding down the CTRL key while dropping the link or image.
  - Automatic conversion of image URLs and YouTube links into image elements with original links added as a link on the element when pasting. Note, that if you only want to paste the plain text link (not the image), first double-click the canvas to start a new text element, then paste the link.
- Two new options added to plugin settings:
  - Make mouse wheel zoom by default [#474](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/474)

# Minor QoL improvements
- When you open a second drawing in the same Excalidraw view (i.e. by navigating a link) and make a change to this drawing, and then press UNDO, the entire drawing disappeared. Redo brought the image back, however, this behavior was frustrating. Not anymore...
- On iPad
  - when you open the command palette, autozoom resized the drawing. If the Obsidian command palette or some other modal window is shown Excalidraw will not resize the view.
  - when you add a link to the drawing using the Command Palette, sometimes the link was added in a far corner of the drawing outside the current view area. This should be fixed now.`,

# New
- The plugin now includes support for [Perfect Freehand](https://perfect-freehand-example.vercel.app/) pen-options. I've also added a new [Alternative Pens](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Alternative%20Pens.md) script.
- Embed scene in exported PNG and SVG images [#860](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/860).  This means that the export will be a normal PNG or SVG image with the added functionality that if someone loads the image into excalidraw.com it will open as a normal excalidraw file.
  - I've added 2 new Command Palette actions (export PNG, export SVG with embedded scene).
  - If you SHIFT click ${String.fromCharCode(96)} Save as PNG (or SVG)${String.fromCharCode(96)} in the workspace-tab menu, Excalidraw will embed the scene in the export.
- I updated the [Organic Line](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Organic%20Line.md)  script. It has an improved thick-to-thin look and a new thin-to-thick-to-thin line type.

# Fixed
- Intelligent image width setting [#955](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/955). Before this change, when the embedded image was small, the image would be extended to meet the image width setting in plugin settings. From now on, if the image is smaller than max-width, it will only extend to max-width. You can still set 100% width using custom CSS. See more on that [here](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin#embedded-images).

# New in ExcalidrawAutomate
- I added the ${String.fromCharCode(96)} plaintext${String.fromCharCode(96)} parameter to ${String.fromCharCode(96)}ExcalidrawAutomate.create${String.fromCharCode(96)} . Using this, you can add some text below the frontmatter but above the ${String.fromCharCode(96)}# Text Elements${String.fromCharCode(96)} section. Use this for example to add metadata to your file. (e.g. I use this in my Daily Quote template to add a Dataview field for the ${String.fromCharCode(96)}Author::${String.fromCharCode(96)} and add the quote with a standard block reference, so I can easily reference it in other files. I also add the ${String.fromCharCode(96)}#quote${String.fromCharCode(96)} tag to the file using this.)
- The script running in the ScriptEngine now also receives the ${String.fromCharCode(96)}TFile${String.fromCharCode(96)} object for the script itself. You can access this object during execution via the ${String.fromCharCode(96)}utils.scriptFile${String.fromCharCode(96)} variable.

- changed ${String.fromCharCode(96)}viewToggleFullScreen(forceViewMode: boolean = false): void${String.fromCharCode(96)}: the function will toggle view mode on when going to full screen and view mode off when terminating full screen.
- new functions
${String.fromCharCode(96, 96, 96)}typescript
setViewModeEnabled(enabled: boolean):void;
viewUpdateScene(
    scene: {
      elements?: ExcalidrawElement[];
      appState?: AppState;
      files?: BinaryFileData;
      commitToHistory?: boolean;
    },
    restore: boolean = false,

## New and fixes from Excalidraw.com
- New text paste behavior. Pasting multiline text will generate separate text elements unless you hold down the shift button while pasting [#5786](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5786)
- line editor fixes [#5927](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5927)

## Fixed
- The Command Palette "Insert link" action now inserts the new link at the top drawing layer, not at the bottom.
- Updated, hopefully, better organized, Plugin Readme.

## New
- Second attempt at moving to React 18. This upgrade is required to maintain alignment with the core Excalidraw product and to continue to benefit from Excalidraw.com enhancements.
- Added options to Plugin Settings
  - to disable autozoom when loading a drawing for the first time [#907](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/907)
  - to modify autosave interval. You can now set an autosave interval for desktop and for mobile [#888](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/888)

## New in ExcalidrawAutomate
- Published the obsidian_module on the ExcalidrawAutomate object. ${String.fromCharCode(96)}ExcalidrawAutomate.obsidian${String.fromCharCode(96)}. Publishing this object will give script developers increased flexibility and control over script automation.

## New
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Introducing the MVP (minimum viable product) release of the integration of [Taskbone](https://taskbone.com) OCR into Excalidraw. See the new scan button on the Obsidian tools panel.
- New and improved full-screen mode
  - Activate using the Obsidian tools panel, the Obsidian Command Palette, or the Alt+F11 shortcut
  - The ESC key no longer closes full-screen
  - Full-screen mode works properly on iOS as well
- Improved Icon visibility on the Obsidian tools panel
- Added 3 additional buttons to the tools panel
  - Force save
  - Open link (useful on Mobile devices). In the case of LaTeX equations, the button opens the equation properties.
  - Open the link in a new pane. In the case of embedded markdown documents, the button opens the embed properties.

## Fixed
- The [deconstruct selected elements into a new drawing](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/blob/master/ea-scripts/Deconstruct%20selected%20elements%20into%20new%20drawing.md) script now also correctly decomposes transcluded text elements.

"1.7.30":`
Fix:
- Forcing the embedded image to always scale to 100% (a feature introduced in [1.7.26](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/releases/tag/1.7.26)) scaled the embedded excalidraw drawings incorrectly on devices with a pixel ratio of 2 or 3 (e.g. iPads). This is now fixed, however, this fix might retrospectively impact drawings that use this feature. Sorry for that.
`,
"1.7.29":`
- This is a big update that accommodates the **UI redesign** on Excalidraw.com [#5780](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5780). The change on the surface may seem superficial, however, I had to tweak a number of things to make it work in Obsidian. I hope I found everything that broke and fixed it, if not, I'll try to fix it quickly...
- This update also comes with changes under the hood that **fix issues with Excalidraw Automate** - paving the way for further scripts, plus some smaller bug fixes.
- I **reworked text wrapping**. In some cases, text wrapping in SVG exports looked different compared to how the text looked in Excalidraw. This should now be fixed.
- If you are using the **Experimental Dynamic Styling** of the Excalidraw Toolbar, then I recommend updating your styling script following base on [this](https://gist.github.com/zsviczian/c7223c5b4af30d5c88a0cae05300305c)

## Fixed
- Large drawings freeze on the iPad when opening the file. I implemented a workaround whereby Excalidraw will avoid zoom-to-fit drawings with over 1000 elements. [#863](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/863)
- Reintroduced copy/paste to the context menu
`,
"1.7.26":`## Fixed
- Transcluded block with a parent bullet does not embed sub-bullet [#853](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/853)
- Transcluded text will now exclude ^block-references at end of lines
- Phantom duplicates of the drawing appear when "zoom to fit" results in a zoom value below 10% and there are many objects on the canvas [#850](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/issues/850)
- CTRL+Wheel will increase/decrease zoom in steps of 5% matching the behavior of the "+" & "-" zoom buttons.
- Latest updates from Excalidarw.com
  - Freedraw flip not scaling correctly [#5752](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5752)
  - Multiple elements resizing regressions [#5586](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/5586)

## New - power user features
- Force the embedded image to always scale to 100%. Note: this is a very niche feature with a very particular behavior that I built primarily for myself (even more so than other features in Excalidraw Obsidian - also built primarily for myself üòâ)... This will reset your embedded image to 100% size every time you open the Excalidraw drawing, or in case you have embedded an Excalidraw drawing on your canvas inserted using this function, every time you update the embedded drawing, it will be scaled back to 100% size. This means that even if you resize the image on the drawing, it will reset to 100% the next time you open the file or you modify the original embedded object. This feature is useful when you decompose a drawing into separate Excalidraw files, but when combined onto a single canvas you want the individual pieces to maintain their actual sizes. I use this feature to construct Book-on-a-Page summaries from atomic drawings.
- I added an action to the command palette to temporarily disable/enable Excalidraw autosave. When autosave is disabled, Excalidraw will still save your drawing when changing to another Obsidian window, but it will not save every 10 seconds. On a mobile device (but also on a desktop) this can lead to data loss if you terminate Obsidian abruptly (i.e. swipe the application away, or close Obsidian without first closing the drawing). Use this feature if you find Excalidraw laggy.`,
